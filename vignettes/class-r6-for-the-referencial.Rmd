# r6_referential

With XlsForm, we can not filter as we want because the order inside the file is important. For me the first thing to do is to separate our file with begin and end group


```{r examples-r6_referential}
ref <- Referential$new(
  path = system.file("household_survey_americas.xlsx", package = "surveyDesigner") 
)

head(ref$data$survey)

# Example by groups
ref$by_groups$group_intro
```

# Utils for xlsx
